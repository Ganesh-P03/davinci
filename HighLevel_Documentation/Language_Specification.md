# **Language Specification Document**

- Complete list of features 

- Principle and paradign followed 

- Alternative way of implementing the operation not supported by processor 

- Library built to support the features and functionlity 

- Machine/assembly code of these library. they should be in a object file format. 

- Demonstration: 

- the programs which are completely supported by the entire stack of systems 

- Easy1, Easy2, Easy3, Easy4, Moder1, Moder2, Compl1, Compl2 

Language specification: 

- Language specification to be completed 

- Compare your language with C/C++

 - Give reasoning on Why have you added the features 

- What are the new features or innovations in your language?

 Rules: 

- Grammar rules for 80% -100% of the features to be completed 

- Catalogue of error messages 

- Error message to be echoed during each phase of the from preprocessing to loading Library 

preparation: 

- Demonstration: 

Example code1 to code10:

 Prepare at least 10 programs demonstrating each and every features of your programming language 

- Demonstration: 

Example complex code: Write two complex programs to demonstrate the capabilities of your language 

- the program should finally run on your processor 

- Write program to find out Inverse of given nxm matrix 

- Implement Height Balance search tree with all the basic operations 

- adding element, deleting, searching, adding subtree etc, in your language 

Final demonstration: Prepare of library of set of functions

------------------------------------------



* Support procedural programming paradigm allowing you to write functions or methods to perform specific tasks.


## Language Description:



1. Procedural and Object-based Programming language
2. The program is a collection of 1 or more classes, one of which must be named `Main. `Main.main is the entry point for the program.
3.
