WARNING: [DRC CHECK-3] Report rule limit reached: REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net control_unit/mainDecoder/ramIsRead is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control_unit/mainDecoder/RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1/O, cell control_unit/mainDecoder/RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT control_unit/mainDecoder/RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 mem/ram/RAM_reg_bram_0 has an input control pin mem/ram/RAM_reg_bram_0/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: mem/ram/O[0]) which is driven by a register (control_unit/mainDecoder/FSM_onehot_state_reg[11]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
