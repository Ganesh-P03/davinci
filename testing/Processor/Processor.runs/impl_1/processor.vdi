INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net control_unit/mainDecoder/PC1_reg[17] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control_unit/mainDecoder/byte_write[1].RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1/O, cell control_unit/mainDecoder/byte_write[1].RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT control_unit/mainDecoder/byte_write[1].RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
mem/readKeyboard_reg
WARNING: [DRC ZPS7-1] PS7 block required: The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
