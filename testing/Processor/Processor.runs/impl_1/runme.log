WARNING: [DRC CHECK-3] Report rule limit reached: REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net mem/ramIsRead is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mem/ram_i_4/O, cell mem/ram_i_4. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT mem/ram_i_4 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
mem/dample_reg, mem/keyVal_reg[0], mem/keyVal_reg[1], mem/keyVal_reg[2], mem/keyVal_reg[3], mem/keyVal_reg[4], mem/keyVal_reg[5], mem/keyVal_reg[6], mem/keyVal_reg[7], and mem/readKeyboard_reg
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 mem/ram/RAM_reg_bram_0 has an input control pin mem/ram/RAM_reg_bram_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: mem/ram/address[7]) which is driven by a register (control_unit/mainDecoder/state_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
