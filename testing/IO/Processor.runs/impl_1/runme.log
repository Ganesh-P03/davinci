Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
WARNING: [Place 30-568] A LUT 'control_unit/mainDecoder/RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1' is driving clock pin of 9 registers. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved registers are:
	mem/readKeyboard_reg {FDRE}
	mem/keyVal_reg[0] {FDRE}
	mem/keyVal_reg[4] {FDRE}
	mem/keyVal_reg[1] {FDRE}
	mem/dample_reg {FDRE}
WARNING: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	ps2c_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X0Y50
	ps2c_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y3
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.

WARNING: [DRC CHECK-3] Report rule limit reached: REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net control_unit/mainDecoder/ramIsRead is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control_unit/mainDecoder/RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1/O, cell control_unit/mainDecoder/RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT control_unit/mainDecoder/RAM_mux_sel_b_pos_3_i_1 is driving clock pin of 9 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
mem/dample_reg, mem/keyVal_reg[0], mem/keyVal_reg[1], mem/keyVal_reg[2], mem/keyVal_reg[3], mem/keyVal_reg[4], mem/keyVal_reg[5], mem/keyVal_reg[6], and mem/readKeyboard_reg
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 mem/ram/RAM_reg_bram_0 has an input control pin mem/ram/RAM_reg_bram_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: mem/ram/ADDRARDADDR[5]) which is driven by a register (control_unit/mainDecoder/state_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
