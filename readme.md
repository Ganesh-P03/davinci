Key Components

Custom High-Level Language: Designed a specialized programming language, JACK, specifically tailored for this system.

Compiler: Built a compiler to translate JACK programs into executable machine code.

Virtual Machine (VM): Developed an intermediate execution environment to abstract the underlying hardware.

Assembler: Created an assembler to convert human-readable assembly instructions into binary machine code.

Operating System (OS): Developed a custom OS to manage system resources and provide a platform for application execution.

RISC-V Architecture Chip: Designed and implemented a custom RISC-V processor on a Vivado board, forming the core hardware.
